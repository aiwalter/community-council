# PyData2021 tutorial: "How to improve your time series forecast using sktime"


## Short description
Time series are ubiquitous in real-world applications, but often add considerable complications to data science workflows. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about how to apply and extend machine learning techniques to time series. The tutorial will continue the [PyData tutorial from 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf2naBHRo8Q&t=1240s) with a deeper dive into pipelining, tuning, backtesting. Further, you will learn about the learning problems of time series annotation and time series clustering.

## Long description
Time series are ubiquitous in real-world applications, but often add considerable complications to data science workflows. What's more, most available machine learning toolboxes (e.g. scikit-learn) are limited to the tabular setting, and cannot easily be applied to time series data. 

In the [PyData tutorial from 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf2naBHRo8Q&t=1240s) of sktime, you have learned how to apply common machine learning techniques to time series data and how to extend available toolkits.

As introduction to this tutorial, you'll quickly recapitulate the existing learning problems in the context of time series data, such as forecasting, classification/regression, transformation, annotation and clustering.

In this tutorial, you will learn more advanced forecasting concepts like pipelining, tuning, backtesting, model selection and how to incorporate exogenous data into this concepts.

We'll work through all of this step by step and make use of interactive Jupyter notebooks and sktime, a new scikit-learn compatible toolbox for machine learning with time series (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime).
